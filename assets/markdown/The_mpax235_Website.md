<h3 id="Development_(July_16th,_2024_-_September_1st,_2024)">Development (July 16th, 2024 - September 1st, 2024)</h3>
<p>On July 16th, 2024, the website was first created but not published yet, and at the same time, the repository containing the code for the website was created, but private.</p>
<p>On August 31st, 2024, the first blog post "MediaTek Details: Preloader" was created. This blog post had information about how the MediaTek Preloader in MediaTek devices works. Sometime later, the repository was made public.</p>
<h3 id="Release_(September_1st,_2024_-_Present)">Release (September 1st, 2024 - Present)</h3>
<p>On September 1st, 2024, the website was published for the first time on the domain "https://mpax235.github.io/website". The website was called "mpax235 Website V1" internally, referring to the first design of the website.</p>
<p>6 days later, the second blog post called "MediaTek Details: Little Kernel" was made. But it got removed on December 21st, 2024, due to it being unfinished. But it was eventually brought back on January 28th, 2025 when the 10/03/2024 version became available on the website. 1 day after the blog post was made, the "mpax235 Website V2" design was launched. Making the website more modern according to the commit logs.</p>
<p>On September 24th, 2024, the third blog post called "Exploring the limits of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition" was added. 10 days later, the "mpax235 Website V3" design was launched which revamped the website further. Some pages were removed as they were non-functional, others stayed.</p>
<p>On October 22nd, 2024, the website went into maintenance mode as the "mpax235 Website V4" design was being worked on. 1 day later, the website returned with the aforementioned design. The gallery was added 2 days after the website went into maintenance and was only exclusive to the "Exploring the limits of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition".</p>
<p>On December 8th, 2024, the domain was changed to "https://mpax235.github.io". 12 days later, the "mpax235 Website V5" design was launched on the website. As a result this broke the website for older devices that couldn't handle the following CSS properties: Transparent Backgrounds and the Blur Backdrop. The footer was also disabled for 3 days before it came back.</p>
<p>From December 30th-31st 2024 and January 1st, 2025, there was a New Year's countdown on the website. Counting down until the new year depending on the user's location. It was disabled on January 2nd, 2025, with it being removed but the code responsible for the countdown still present.</p>
<p>On January 25th, 2025, support for Internet Explorer and Waterfox Classic ended. 3 days later, the 10-03-2024 version of the website was added to the Versions tab and the Versions page was added. 3 days later after that, support for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U browsers ended.</p>
<p>The big change happened on May 18th, 2025 when the domain was changed to "https://mpax235.freakybob.site". Which was a custom domain and not a GitHub Pages one. After "https://mpax235.github.io" got shut off, almost everything that relied on that website broke. So mpax235 had to migrate everything, after which 5quirre1 and mpax235 worked together to make the freakybob.site domain go online.</p>
